How to setup a dev environment:
===============================

setup:
-------
- install mongoDB 1.8 

- install Play 1.2.4
 + add the following Spring integration module into Play:  http://www.playframework.org/modules/spring-1.0.2/home
 + get this fork of the play Spring integration module https://github.com/svendx4f/Play--framework-Spring-module, compile it and replace the jar produced by previous step with the jar from this fork

- install Solr 3.6.0
 +  get the altermotif solr config and schema from here: https://github.com/svendx4f/altermotif_solr

- git clone this project

- run this in order to download all dependencies: 
  play dependency --sync
  
=> at this point you should have everything to run the application locally.


running the application:
--------------------------
- start mongodb.
- start solr 
- have a look at conf/application-context.xml in order to make sure the mongodb coordinates are ok for you mongo setup (if you used all default values with no security, it should be ok)
- make sure conf/application.conf contains "play.spring.profile=devLocal", which means "using parameters for local development" (including local mongo DB)
- run this:

play clean
play precompile
play run

(in most of the cases, only the last one is required, but some pre-compilation is sometimes required due to a but in the Spring/Play integration module) 



editing the code with Eclipse:
----------------------------------
- install STS 2.9.2  
- start Eclise, import the code => Eclise should complain about missing libs
     * in Eclipse define a variable called PLAY pointing to the place where the Play framework is installed
     * in Eclipse, define a "user library" containing all the libs in lib/ of this project (that were downloaded by "play dependency" above)
