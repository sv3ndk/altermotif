How to setup a dev environment:
===============================

setup:
-------
- install mongoDB 1.8 

- install Play 1.2.4
 + add the following Spring integration module into Play:  http://www.playframework.org/modules/spring-1.0.2/home
 + get this fork of the play Spring integration module https://github.com/svendx4f/Play--framework-Spring-module, compile it and replace the jar produced by previous step with the jar from this fork

- install Solr 3.6.0
 +  get the altermotif solr config and schema from here: https://github.com/svendx4f/altermotif_solr

- git clone the current project

- run this in order to download all dependencies: 
  play dependency --sync
  
=> at this point you should have everything to run the application locally.


running the application locally:
--------------------------
- start mongodb.
- start solr 
- have a look at conf/application-context.xml in order to make sure the mongodb coordinates are ok for you mongo setup (if you used all default values with no security, it should be ok)
- make sure conf/application.conf contains "play.spring.profile=devLocal", which means "using parameters for local development" (including local mongo DB)
- run this:

play clean
play precompile
play run

(in most of the cases, only the last one is required, but some pre-compilation is sometimes required due to a but in the Spring/Play integration module) 



editing the code with Eclipse:
----------------------------------
- install STS 2.9.2  
- start Eclise, import the code => Eclise should complain about missing libs
     * in Eclipse define a variable called PLAY pointing to the place where the Play framework is installed
     * in Eclipse, define a "user library" containing all the libs in lib/ of this project (that were downloaded by "play dependency" above)   


Installing a Solr instance of EC server (with pre-installed)
------------------------------------------------------------
A zip of the whole solr server (with appropriate config) has been uploaded here:

=> unzip it to some folder on the EC2 instance, make sure Java is available, and start it

As an alternative, it is also possible to install it manually (see next section)


Installing a Solr instance of EC server (manually)
----------------------------------------

- if necessary, create an EC2 instance (I used Ubuntu image: Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS (ami-a29943cb))

- follow EC2 instruction to log to it via SSH from computer 

- download solr: 
   wget http://apache.belnet.be/lucene/solr/3.6.0/apache-solr-3.6.0.zip

- install unzip:
   sudo apt-get install unzip

- unzip Solr: 
   unzip apache-solr-3.6.0.zip

- install java:
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre

- install git:
   sudo apt-get install git
   
- follow git instruction to add ssh keys:
  => read this: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys  
  (I used "altermotif" without the quotes as passphrase for the ssh key)
 		
- get the altermotif config from solr into the altermotif folder:
  git clone git@github.com:svendx4f/altermotif_solr.git altermotif
  
- deploy patch 2155 to solr for geographic search 
   => read this: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SpatialSearch#SOLR-2155
   
- start solr :-)
  cd ..
  java -jar start.jar
